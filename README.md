# Bike-Share-Portfolio-Project
This was my capstone project for the Google Data Analyst Certificate.

## ABOUT THE COMPANY 

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oﬀering. Since then, the program has grown to a ﬂeet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 
Cyclistic’s ﬁnance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more proﬁtable than casual riders. Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders diﬀer, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could aﬀect their marketing tactics.

## BUSINESS TASK

1. Define differences between the bike usage of annual members and casual riders.
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to inﬂuence casual riders to become members?

## DATA SOURCE

The data has been made available by Motivate international Inc.    
For the purpose of this portfolio project, I have extracted a random sample of 1/10th of the data for Q1-Q4 of 2019. In addition, I have removed outliers, incorrect data (subscribers aged 85 and over, some subscriber were listed at age 100 and over), as well as missing data.
